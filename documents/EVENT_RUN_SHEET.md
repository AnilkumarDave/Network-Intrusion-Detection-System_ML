# 🗓️ Event Day Run-Sheet — Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

This schedule outlines the step-by-step flow for demonstrating and presenting the **Machine Learning–based Network Intrusion Detection System** project.

| Time   | Activity |
|--------|---------|
| 14:00  | **Project briefing & setup** — introduce the concept of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), project objectives, and academic background. |
| 14:05  | **Dataset overview** — explain the KDD Cup 1999 dataset, data attributes, and preprocessing (encoding, scaling, balancing with SMOTE). |
| 14:10  | **Model training demonstration** — run the training notebook to show how multiple ML classifiers (GaussianNB, RandomForest, KNN, SVC, AdaBoost) are trained. |
| 14:20  | **Model evaluation & visualization** — display accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC metrics with corresponding confusion matrices. |
| 14:25  | **Comparison analysis** — visually compare classifiers and explain why AdaBoost achieved the best results. |
| 14:30  | **Result storage walkthrough** — show how results, figures, and metrics are automatically saved under the `results/` folder. |
| 14:35  | **Repository & code structure** — explain folder organization: `src/`, `results/`, and `documents/`, and highlight modular Python scripts. |
| 14:40  | **Future scope discussion** — outline next steps (real-time IDS integration, deep learning models, cloud deployment). |
| 14:45  | **Q&A & Feedback** — open discussion on methodology, performance, limitations, and academic contributions. |
