# 🕒 Progress Hours Breakdown — Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

This table summarises the estimated hours spent per category during the project development and documentation phases.

| Category | Hours | Description |
|----------|-------|------------|
| 📝 PLAN | 10 | Defined project objectives, scope, and key performance indicators (KPIs). Outlined methodology, dataset selection (KDD Cup 1999), and project milestones. |
| ⚙️ SETUP | 6 | Configured Python environment (Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook), installed dependencies (scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, imbalanced-learn), and structured folders. |
| 💻 DEV | 45 | Implemented data preprocessing (encoding, scaling, balancing), trained ML models (GaussianNB, Random Forest, KNN, SVC, AdaBoost), and built evaluation pipeline. |
| 📊 ANALYSIS | 18 | Compared classifiers using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrices. Created visual comparisons and summarized findings. |
| 🧪 TEST | 14 | Validated model performance, ran cross-validation, ensured consistent reproducibility, and checked data flow integrity. |
| 📄 DOC | 18 | Authored dissertation chapters, README.md, changelog, progress logs, and roadmap diagram. Ensured documentation clarity and alignment with academic standards. |
| 🎓 PRESENTATION | 7 | Prepared final project presentation materials, demonstration plan, and submission-ready repository. |

**🧮 Total Estimated Hours:** ~125 hrs
