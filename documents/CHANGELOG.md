## 🧩 2023-06-26 → 2023-09-06 — Original Academic Development

Developed as part of **MSc Information Security & Digital Forensics** at the **University of East London**.  
Supervised by **Dr. Ameer Al-Nemrat**.

Academic research project demonstrating a **Machine Learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** using the **KDD Cup 1999 dataset**.

### Core Deliverables
- Preprocessing pipeline (encoding, scaling, and balancing with SMOTE)  
- Multiple classifier implementations — *GaussianNB, RandomForest, KNN, SVC, AdaBoost*  
- Model evaluation using **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC**, and **confusion matrices**  
- Visualization of model performance comparisons  
- Report and documentation submitted as part of MSc dissertation

## ⚙️ 2025-10-25 — Repository Reconstruction

Recreated repository from original academic archives and backup notebooks.  
Standardized folder structure for clarity:

src/ → scripts for preprocessing, training, evaluation, visualization
results/ → metrics, figures, and confusion matrices
data/ → KDDTest+, KDDTrain+
documents/ → dissertation, references, and logs


- Cleaned and commented all Jupyter notebooks for readability  
- Ensured reproducibility with **Python 3.11** and modern library versions

## 🧠 2025-10-27 — Enhancements & Documentation

- Added **README.md** with detailed overview, objectives, KPIs, advantages, limitations, and methodology  
- Introduced **Modernisation Note** and **Disclaimer** to reflect academic purpose  
- Created structured **academic timeline** and **chapter-wise outline**  
- Added new **Project Roadmap Diagram** illustrating six-stage workflow  
- Documented **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** in table format for transparent comparison  

---

## 🗂️ 2025-10-30 — Repository Expansion

Added `documents/` folder with structured academic documentation:

- `REFERENCES.md` — literature references and research citations  
- `ROADMAP.png` — visual roadmap diagram of project lifecycle  
- `progress_log.md` — timeline of daily or phase-wise progress  

Updated result-saving paths and ensured visual outputs auto-save during evaluation.
